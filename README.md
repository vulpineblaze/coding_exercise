## Requirements
Write a Hello World program:

### The program has 1 current business requirement a write Hello World to the console/screen.
* Will print a server-side variable to HTML.

### The program should have an API that is separated from the program logic to eventually support mobile applications, web applications, console applications or windows services.
* Will take in new data to the server, then overwrite the client-side variable

### The program should support future enhancements for writing to a database, console application, etc.
* Use Express.js, comment those specific lines for mlab handling of the variable

#### Use common design patterns (inheritance, e.g.) to account for these future concerns.
* This will happen reflexively

#### Use configuration files or another industry standard mechanism for determining where to write the information to.
* This will occur using the mlab integration

### Write unit tests to support the AP
* Selenium webdriver for node
